# Churn
Customer churn is a million-dollar problem for businesses today. The SaaS market is becoming increasingly saturated, and customers can choose 
from plenty of providers. Retention and nurturing are challenging. Online businesses view customers as churn when they stop purchasing goods and services. 
Customer churn can depend on industry-specific factors, yet some common drivers include lack of product usage, contract tenure, and cheaper prices elsewhere.
Limiting churn strengthens your revenue streams. Businesses and marketers must predict and prevent customer churn to remain sustainable. 
The best way to do so is by knowing your customers. And spotting behavioral patterns in historical data can help immensely with this. 
Applying machine learning (ML) to customer data helps companies develop focused customer-retention programs. 
For example, a marketing department could use an ML churn model to identify high-risk customers and send promotional content to entice them.
